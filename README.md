### Rationale behind this repository
I noticed that using this version(5.0.0) of the app, i am able to mark attendance without going to class.  
The app asks you to update it but you can bypass it by following the instructions below.*

## Instructions
- Goto Settings->Apps->Attendance->Storage
  - Click on Clear cache & Clear data
- Uninstall current attendance app
- Download the apk.
- Click on the apk file & click install
  - You may need to enable *install unknown apps* in settings
    - Search on google if you cant find the setting (varies from phone to phone)
- Open the app
- If it shows a pop-up asking you to update, try closing the pop-up
- If the update pop-up opens again & again, follow these steps
  - Turn off wifi & mobile data
  - Type usename & password
  - Turn on mobile data & immediately click login
- Once you have logged-in, pop-up appears only once or twice which can be closed normally
